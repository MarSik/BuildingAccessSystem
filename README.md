# NFC entry system using TI Tiva C platform - with DESfire support

The aim is to use the [Tiva C Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl) together with [PN532 NFC interface boards](https://www.adafruit.com/products/364) to create a secure building access system.

This project is based on [Elmu's code for Teensy](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1096861/DIY-electronic-RFID-Door-Lock-with-Battery-Backup).

## Development environment
